# Govee

Official app for the Govee WIFI enabled devices. This app supports the main light functions and appliance opperations as they are available in the Govee Cloud API or through local API discovery (Pro only).

Getting started

Cloud devices
For cloud features you need to use the Govee mobile app to request the API key for you account. After installing the Homey Govee app you can set the API key in the app settings (or during first deviec pairing). Now you can add the Govee devices.

Local devices (Pro only)
Local API devices can be added using the special device type. These work fully local without any cloud. These functions are limited, for example scene support will not work. However you can enable a hybrid mode by selecting the cloud enhancement features. This does require the API key as described in the cloud devices section.

Supprted devices
Currently the app supports the:
All cloud API enabled devices/appliances
All local API enabled devices
You can cloud boost your local API devices (allowing for cloud only operations)

You can set basic power/light operations, select light scenes (cloud only), select DIY scenes (cloud only), activate a snapshot (cloud only), enable music mode (cloud only).
